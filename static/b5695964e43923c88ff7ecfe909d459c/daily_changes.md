This chart compares three different derivates of confirmed cases (C) and deaths (D) respectively.

The first column shows the absolute numbers over time.

The second column shows the day to day increase of the according numbers. The chart is smoothed using a rolling average over 7 days.

The last chart shows the day to day change of the second chart. So basically it shows how fast the day to day numbers increase or - more importantly - decrease. A positive value indicates that the day to day value grew in comparison to the previous day. Which means that the virus is spreading even faster than the day before. A negative value indicates that the increase rate is slowing down.
