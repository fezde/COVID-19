This chart aims at better understanding what the current infections mean for a certain country. While news reports (or other analyses) usually report the total number of infections per country, that does not really reflect the severness of such an infection. 80.000 infected people means something completely different for a country like China than for a country like Switzerland.

**A little example:**

* 80.000 infected inhabitants in China represent about **0.006%** of the population while the same
* 80.000 infected inhabitants in Switzerland represent about **0.933%** of their population.
