This chart tries to shed light on the amount of people that are currently affected by COVID-19. While the first two columns show the same numbers as the chart in the "Basic Numbers" section [above](#basicNumbers), the third column shows how many people are still ill with COVID-19. So it basically shows the number of `CONFIRMED - DEATHS - RECOVERED`.
