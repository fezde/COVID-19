The goal of this analysis is to see if there is a time correlation between the confirmed cases and the deaths and recovered cases. For this a offset between the two according datasets is found that maximizes the correlation between the two timeseries.

The right-hand side chart shows the distribution for the according time offsets. So this indicates how far (in days) the recovered numbers (or deaths) are behind the reported numbers of confirmed cases.

A detailed description of this analyis can be found on [this page](/page_offsets/).
